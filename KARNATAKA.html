<p>Andhra Pradesh, state of India, located in the southeastern part of the subcontinent. 
It is bounded by the Indian states of Tamil Nadu to the south, Karnataka to the southwest and west,
 Telangana to the northwest and north, and Odisha to the northeast. The eastern boundary is a 600-mile
 (970-km) coastline along the Bay of Bengal. Telangana was a region within Andhra Pradesh for almost six decades,
 but in 2014 it was carved off to form a separate state.
 The capital of both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is Hyderabad, in west-central Telangana.</p>
